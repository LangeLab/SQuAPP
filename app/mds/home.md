## `SQuAPP` *Version 0.25*
**S**imple **Qu**antitative **A**nalysis of **P**eptides and **P**roteins (`SQuAPP`) is a workflow-based web application built on R-Shiny to enable a rapid high-level analysis of quantitative proteomics data.  SQuAPP provides streamlined and straightforward access to many aspects of typical downstream analysis done with quantitative proteomics data. SQuAPP can bring multiple levels of proteomics data to process and visually compare them for further visualizations.

Mandatory quality control and conscious pre-processing early in the workflow ensure that only robust data are quantitatively evaluated and visualized. The processed datasets can be downloaded for further custom analysis, and the comprehensive report supports record keeping and allows easy sharing with colleagues and collaborators.

#### Functionality

`SQuAPP` is a flexible application and can apply the functionality in a non-sequential order as long as the requirements for a specific functionality are met. `SQuAPP` also can be used to follow a workflow-driven approach with the following sequential steps:

1. **Data Setup**
2. **Data Inspection**
3. **Data Pre-processing**
4. **Statistical inference**
5. **Summary Visualization**
6. **Report generation**
