## **SQuAPP** *Version 0.25*

**S**imple **Qu**antitative **A**nalysis of **P**eptides and **P**roteins allows you to do just that, using an streamlined Shiny interface you or your collaborators can rapidly assess quantitative proteomics data at the peptide, PTM and protein level.

Mandatory quality control and conscious pre-processing early in the workflow ensures that only robust data is quantitatively evaluated and visualized. The processed datasets can be downloaded for further custom analysis and the comprehensive report supports record keeping and allows easy sharing with colleagues and collaborators.

SQuAPP follows a workflow driven approach with the following sequential steps:

1. Data upload
2. QC on Standard-level & Sample-level
3. Pre-processing
4. Statistical inference
5. Data visualization
6. Report generation.
